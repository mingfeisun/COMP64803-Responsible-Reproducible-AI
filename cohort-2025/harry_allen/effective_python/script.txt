1 - (Item 20) Prefer Raising Exceptions to Returning 'None':

	It seems to make sense to give a special meaning to the return value 'None'. Problems arise mainly if we try to evaluate the result in a condition (e.g. an if statement). This is because 'None' is False-equivalent (along with zero, empty string) all evaluate to 'False' in conditional expressions.
	Instead, we should raise exceptions to indicate special situations.
