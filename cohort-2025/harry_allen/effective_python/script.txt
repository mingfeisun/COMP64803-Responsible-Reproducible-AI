1 - (Item 20) Prefer Raising Exceptions to Returning 'None':

	It seems to make sense to give a special meaning to the return value 'None'. Problems arise mainly if we try to evaluate the result in a condition (e.g. an if statement). This is because 'None' is False-equivalent (along with zero, empty string) all evaluate to 'False' in conditional expressions.
	Instead, we should raise exceptions to indicate special situations.

2 - (Item 2) Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide:

	Python Enhancement Proposal #8, is the style guide for formatting Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Some rules are as follows:
		- Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation (four spaces for each level).
		- Lines should be max. 79 characters.
		- Functions and classes should be separated by two blank lines.
		- etc.
		- Also naming rules:
			- Capitalise classnames.
			- Private instance attributes should be in __double_leading_underscore format.
			- Module-level constants should be in ALL_CAPS format.
			- etc.

	The Pylint tool is a static analyser for Python source code, which automatically enforces the PEP 8 style guide.

3 - (Item 65) Take Advantage of Each Block in try/except/else/finally:

	Instead of checking for errors manually at each step ("LBYL" - Look Before You Leap), Python encourages "EAFP" - Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission, in other words try something and if it fails handle it.
	The four blocks (try, except, else, finally) give fine-grained control over what code runs depending on whether an exception occurred:
		- try : Run this code that might fail. Only statements inside try are monitored for exceptions.
		- except : If a specific exception happens, execute this handler. Only runs if an exception occurred inside the try block.
		- else : If no exception occurred in the try block, then run this block.
		- finally : Run this code no matter what happened. Used for cleanup actions.
