Q1: "What user are you logged in as by default?"
A1: root

Q2: "If you start and then exit an interactive container, and then use the docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash command again, is it the same container? How can you tell?"
A2: No, it is a new container with a unique ID and name (as not specified in command), but is based off the same image.

Q3: "Run the image you just built. Since we specified the default CMD, you can just do docker run -it mypython:latest. What do you observe?"
A3: Runs python 3.6 in interactive REPL.

Q4: "Write and build a Dockerfile that installs the packages fortune and fortunes-min and runs the fortune executable (located in /usr/games/fortune after you install it). Note that you won’t need to use the -it flags when you run the container as fortune doesn’t need STDIN. Submit your Dockerfile with this lab. Hint: if you’re having trouble writing your Dockerfile, try booting an interactive container and installing both packages. Translate what you did into a Dockerfile. How can you translate what you did interactively to a Dockerfile?"
A4:	cd fortunes/
	docker build -t myfortunes:latest .
	docker run myfortunes:latest
