1. root, which can be checked by running whoami
2. it's not the same container as each time 'docker run ...' is run a new container is created from the image and is assigned a unique container ID. 
   You can tell it is a different container as the ID after 'root@...' is different each time the command is run
3. docker run -it mypython:latest launches the python 3.6 interpreter in interactive mode
4. the Dockerfile installs the fortune-mod and fortunes-min packages, and then runs the command which prints a random fortune, and then exits.
   translating what you would normally do in an interactive environment involves typing the steps in the RUN line, and the final command becomes a CMD line.
   The Dockerfile and the docker image outputs are uploaded separately.
5. the outputs of ps aux are uploaded separately.
   inside the docker container, only the processes that belong to that container are running, whereas in the VM all background system services must run as well.
